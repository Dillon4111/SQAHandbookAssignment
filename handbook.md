# **Coding Standards**

## Benefits of having good coding standards:
- Easy for different team members to read and maintain.
- Reduces code complexity which in turn reduces the number of bugs and errors in the code.
- Makes code more secure, the quality of code is better and it's less likely to be hacked.
- Improves efficiency of programmers as it takes them less time to understand another programmers code and it's easier to test.

## Naming Conventions: 
It's very important to give meaningful names to variables, functions, packages etc. so they are easily undertandable. It's up to the developer what to use but in general...
- CamelCase should be used for local variables e.g firstName. So the first lettter of each word is a capital apart from the first.
- Constants should have all capital letters e.g CONSDATA
- Global variables should start with a capital letter e.g GlobalVariable.
- Avoid using digits in variable names.
- Functions should be written in CamelCase and should describe what it is doing.
- File names should use CamelCase.

## Indentation:
- Must be a space after a coma between two function arguments
- Nested blocks should be properly indented and spaced
- All braces should start from new line
- Appropriate indentation should be at the end of each block.
