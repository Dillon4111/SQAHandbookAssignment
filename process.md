# **Software Quality Assurance Project Plan**

There are three topics that will be discussed within the handbook and two members from the team will be discussing each topic: 
1. **Task Estimation in Scrums** – Danny Brassil & David Murphy
2. **Coding Standards** – Dillon Rochford & David Murphy
3. **Code Reviews** – Danny Brassil and Iteoluwakiishi Ifebajo

 - Each topic will include five good quality resources such as blogs and articles related to the topic and our team will extract the common themes among them to discuss.
- Each pair will first need to decide which resources they will be using for the topics and figure out what to discuss within each resource. 
- They will then need to create their own feature branch that they are working on for each topics so there are no conflicts within each file. Every bit of progress they make will need to be committed regurlarly and code reviews will be created for each merge into the develop branch.
